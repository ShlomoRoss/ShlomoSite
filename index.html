                Outside of his customer (student) facing responsibilities, Shlomo was an excellent employee and asset to the company. His proactive, communicative, and organized work was a program manager's dream, and these qualities were highlighted by directors and the C-suite on 2 particular occasions when Shlomo played a key role in identifying and resolving a highly critical vulnerability within the corporation.
